# GIBBERT
*2020*

A short survival horror game made in a few days. 
Born of an inside joke, it ended up getting a fair amount of attention through a few streamers attempting to beat it,
and later even speedrun it.

GIBBERT's pathfinding uses a node-based A* pathfinding algorithm implementation by sleitnick.
